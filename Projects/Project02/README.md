For this project, the purpose was the create something that would remind the user of the essay "Something is Wrong on the Internet".  This prompt was a bit more challenging since there were many more factors to think of when reading the essay but this prompt made me feel more determined and passionate about creating something compared to the previous project.

I wanted the main attraction of my project to be a creepy voice that wants to make money.  Considering that I was using a responsive voice library, it could say anything that you typed and I used that aspect to my advantage to make something a bit creepier to the player.  I managed to create this voice that calls he player by name.  Playin around with variables and adding them into the text where I wanted someones name to be said really brought out the eeriness of obeying what this voice has to say.
