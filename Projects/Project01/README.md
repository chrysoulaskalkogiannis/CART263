For my first coding project, I decided to use jQuery and jQueryUI to execute the idea for my code.  The purpose of the project was the create something that made the user think of the Greek myth Sisyphus.  The prompt was simple enough for me to help come up with simple ideas for it and also to let me be more creative since this project requires us to work from scratch and not start from an issued template like before.  

When me and my classmates were starting to lean the jQueryUI library in class, the simplicity of the code made it seem to straightforward to use with an easy and accessible documentation to get more information on it.  The jQuery library gave me a way where I can execute my ideas as easy as possible.  The drag and drop functions as well as using CSS and HTML to organize and create assets for my project was exactly what I needed to start creating my code.
